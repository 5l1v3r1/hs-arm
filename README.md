# hs-arm-v8.3-a

Arm recently released a [machine-readable specification for Arm v8.3](https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture/a-profile/exploration-tools) to the public.

This repository contains work towards translating that XML specification into Haskell expressions.
That will make way for all sorts of (dis)assemblers, analyzers, etc.
