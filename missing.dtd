<!-- 
  <exceptions>: a list of exceptions that this instruction can cause.

  Exceptions are grouped together in <exception_group> elements.
  <exception_group> elements contain <exception> elements.

  Attributes:
    group_name: this group of exceptions only applies in certain
      circumstances.

<!--
  <exception>: data about a particular exception this instruction
      can cause.

  Attributes:
    register: the system register in which a bit or bits are set
      when this particular exception is caused.
    field: the field in @register which is set to a value when
      this particular exception is caused. (If not present,
      assume that any of the register fields in the register
      being set indicates this exception has been caused.)
    value: the value that @field in @register is set to when
      this particular exception is caused. (If not present,
      assume that the field is set to 1.)
    name: if @register is not present, the exception will instead
      be described using the name it has in the source pseudocode.
      This is a fallback and so will only be present in few cases.
